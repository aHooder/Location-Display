# Location Display
The Location Display plugin displays the name of the location you are in upon entering.

Not every area is included, namely, some quest specific areas.

Feel free to help out by editing the resources/Locations.json file.

Note: This plugin is based on the [Runescape Region Grid](https://mejrs.github.io/osrs) therefore, some areas may not be 100% accurate. Big thanks to mejrs.
