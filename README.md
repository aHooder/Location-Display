# Location Display
The Location Display plugin displays the name of the location you are in upon entering.

Not every area is included, currently using the [wiki locations](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Locations).

Feel free to help out by editing the resources/Locations.json file.


Note: This plugin is based on the [Runescape Region Grid](https://mejrs.github.io/osrs) therefore, some areas may not be 100% accurate.
